# resistance-utils

I'm an app. Or maybe I'm a library? I haven't decided yet.

The choice is up to you!

## Usage

### basic

Compute the resistance of a resistor (3 to 5 ring).

#### 3 ring resistor:

``` clj
user> (resistor [:brown :black :orange])
10000
```

#### 5 ring resistor

``` clj
user> (resistor [:brown :black :black :orange :brown])
[99000N 101000N]
```
c
### Advanced (Not yet implemented)

Given a resistance, returns the possible resistor combination.

``` clj
user> (resistor 10000 :ohms)
[[:brown :black :orange]
 ...]
```
